# Review of Requirements for Story 1

### Requirement Summary:

*As a user, I want to be able to search for friends by name on the search page. The search result should appear on the results page quickly. The search result must contain the user's photo and nickname. The user's nickname must be clickable, after clicking on the user's nickname, a page with information should be opened.<br>10 values should be displayed on the results page, in order to load more results there should be a ‘Load More’ button.*

## [Solution](#)

### Pros:

- **Specific:** The requirement clearly describes the functionalities — searching by name, displaying results with photos and nicknames, clickable nicknames, and pagination.
- **Relevant:** It focuses on essential user needs for interacting with a social media platform.

### Cons:

- **Vagueness in "Quickly":** The term "quickly" is subjective and not quantifiable, which makes it challenging to test.
- **Ambiguity in Result Display:** It doesn’t specify what happens if the search yields fewer than 10 results, or how errors (like no results or system errors) are handled.
- **Lack of Detail on User Interface and Accessibility:** No specifics on how results are formatted or considerations for accessibility.

### Conclusion:

While the requirement captures the fundamental needs, it lacks enough detail to ensure clear implementation and effective testing. It needs more specifics to enhance clarity, testability, and completeness.

## Questions to Improve the Requirements

1. What specific time frame defines "quickly" for the search results to appear? (e.g., results should load within 2 seconds)
2. How should the system handle searches that result in fewer than 10 results? (e.g., should it still show the 'Load More' button?)
3. What should happen if no results match the search criteria? (e.g., display a "No results found" message)
4. How should error handling be managed for system failures during search?
5. What detailed information is displayed on the user information page accessed from the nickname link?
6. Are there any accessibility features that need to be considered for users with disabilities? (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)
7. How are privacy and security handled in the display and access of user information?
8. What happens when the 'Load More' button is clicked and there are no more results to display?

## How to Apply These Improvements

1. **Revision of Requirement Statements:** Specific answers to the aforementioned questions should be incorporated directly into the requirement statements. For instance, "quickly" should be defined with a specific time frame, and the behavior when fewer than 10 results are found should be explained.

2. **Adjustment of Acceptance Criteria:** The acceptance criteria should be updated to include these new specifics, ensuring that each element is clear and testable.

3. **Expansion of Test Cases:** Additional test cases should be developed based on the refined requirements. Each case should test a specific and detailed aspect of the requirements, including error handling and edge cases.
