# Review of Requirements for Story 2

### Requirement Summary:

*As a user, I want to be able to change my photo.*  

<br>

## [Solution](#)

### Pros:

- **Direct:** The requirement is straightforward and directly addresses a fundamental user need â€” changing their profile photo.

### Cons:

- **Lacks Detail:** It doesn't specify how users will change their photo, what types of files are acceptable, how the UI should handle this feature, or any feedback provided to the user after an attempt to change a photo.
- **No Error Handling:** There is no mention of how the system should respond if the photo change fails (due to an unsupported file type, network issues, etc.).
- **Not Testable in Current Form:** Without specifics, it is difficult to devise test cases that can comprehensively cover all aspects of this functionality.

### Conclusion:

The requirement outlines the basic need but lacks comprehensive detail to ensure it can be implemented precisely and tested thoroughly. It needs to be expanded to include more specifics regarding the process and system behavior.

## Questions to Improve the Requirements

1. What file formats should be supported for the new photo? (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF)
2. Is there a file size limit for the photo uploads?
3. What steps should the user follow to change their photo on the app? (Detail the user interface interactions)
4. What kind of feedback should the user receive once the photo is successfully changed or if the change fails? (e.g., confirmation message, error alert)
5. How should the system handle a photo upload failure? (e.g., due to network issues, file size limits, unsupported formats)
6. Are there any accessibility considerations for this feature? (e.g., can all users easily access and use the photo change functionality)
7. Should the user be able to preview their new photo before finalizing the change?
8. How quickly should the new photo be visible on the user's profile after the change is made?
9. What security considerations need to be addressed when uploading a new photo? (e.g., ensuring secure data transmission)

## How to Apply These Improvements

1. **Revision of Requirement Statements:** Specific answers to the questions should be integrated directly into the requirement statements. For instance, acceptable file formats and sizes should be specified, and the user interface steps for changing a photo should be described.

2. **Adjustment of Acceptance Criteria:** The acceptance criteria should be updated to reflect these new specifics. Each criterion must be measurable and clear, including confirmation of file types, handling of errors, and implementation of user feedback mechanisms.

3. **Expansion of Test Cases:** New test cases should be developed based on the refined requirements. Each test case should cover functionalities such as file upload, error handling, user feedback, and immediate updates to the user profile.
